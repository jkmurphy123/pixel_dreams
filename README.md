# pixel_dreams

A kiosk display app that runs one of many visual "modes" (screen-saver style apps)
fullscreen, plus a **web control panel for live tuning** — change a mode's parameters,
disable a mode, or switch profiles while the display keeps running, with no restart.

Born as a fork of [pixel_drift](../pixel_drift) (revision `e0b0e16`): the mode interface
contract, the registry/config format and all 53 modes are inherited unchanged. What
pixel_dreams adds is the panel and the plumbing the panel needs.

- one controller (`pixel_dreams.py`), one registry (`modes_registry.json`), one config
  per orientation (`modes_config.json` + `configs/*.json`), **53 visual modes**
- one pygame shell; modes never touch the display directly
- an embedded NiceGUI panel, in the same process as the display

## Usage

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt          # add -r requirements-dev.txt for the tests

python pixel_dreams.py --show_modes                      # list configured modes
python pixel_dreams.py --auto 30                         # cycle every 30s, fullscreen
python pixel_dreams.py --play 2 --windowed               # one mode in a window
python pixel_dreams.py --input rotary                    # Raspberry Pi rotary encoder

# with the control panel:
python pixel_dreams.py --auto 30 --panel-port 8090       # panel on http://127.0.0.1:8090/
python pixel_dreams.py --panel-only --panel-port 8090    # panel with no display at all
```

Keys: LEFT/RIGHT switch modes, ESC quits.

## Control panel

Off unless `--panel-port` is given (NiceGUI is imported lazily, so the kiosk runs
without fastapi/uvicorn loaded at all).

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--panel-port N` | serve the panel on port N (127.0.0.1 by default) |
| `--panel-bind ADDR` | bind address; a non-loopback address **requires** `panel_token` in `secrets.json` |
| `--panel-only` | serve the panel without initialising pygame — for preparing a profile offline |
| `--frames N` | exit after N frames (used by the verification tests) |

Pages so far: `/` (active profile + its mode list + live status).
See `designs/PIXEL_DREAMS_DESIGN.md` for the full plan; the source of truth for what is
actually built is that doc's Phase 1 implementation record.

Panel reach: loopback by default. To open it from another machine, add
`"panel_token": "<long random string>"` to `secrets.json` (gitignored — see
`secrets.example.json`) and start with `--panel-bind 0.0.0.0`, then visit
`http://<host>:8090/?token=<the token>` once. That sets an httpOnly cookie which lasts **60 days**,
so the token is not needed again in that browser until it expires (or you change the token, which
invalidates every existing cookie). Scripts should send `X-Panel-Token: <token>` instead — that
form is never remembered as a cookie.

## Configuration

- `modes_registry.json` — mode *types* (entrypoints + defaults + per-param UI metadata)
- `modes_config.json` — mode *instances* (what actually plays)
- `configs/*.json` — **profiles**: one per display orientation (portrait, landscape,
  narrow_horz, narrow_vert, jetson, windows, basic)
- `modes_config.local.json` — optional per-host overrides (gitignored)
- `secrets.json` — API keys and the panel token (gitignored, see `secrets.example.json`)
- `runtime/active_profile.json` — which profile is active (gitignored, written by the panel)

Validate everything after editing:

```bash
python validate_configs.py --all
```

See AGENTS.md for the developer guide, including the panel's thread rules.
